# AI-Chatbot
 This project is a GPT-2 based chatbot designed to answer questions interactively. The bot uses a CSV file to look up predefined answers, and if the answer is not found, it generates a response dynamically using the GPT-2 model. The chatbot interface is built using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web interface for interaction.
